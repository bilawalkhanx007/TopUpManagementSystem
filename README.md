# Application Architecture Explanation

Our project is built upon the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with a clean architecture approach, which emphasizes the organization of the application around the domain model, encapsulating the problem space the software addresses. This architecture divides the application into three main sections, each with distinct responsibilities aimed at achieving maintainability, scalability, and flexibility.
i)   Core 
ii)  Infrastructure
iii) Presentation


# Core
The Core section serves as the foundation of our application and consists of two key modules: Application and Domain.
## Application Module
This module is structured to accommodate feature-specific implementations. We've adopted the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to meticulously separate concerns between read and write operations. By segregating these responsibilities, we ensure cleaner, more maintainable code. Each feature is implemented independently, enhancing code organization and modularity.
## Domain Module: 
 At the heart of our architecture lies the Domain module, where we encapsulate all project-related concepts. Here, you'll find abstractions, enumerations, entities, view models, and exception handling mechanisms. This module embodies the essential business logic and domain rules, ensuring that our application accurately reflects the requirements of the problem domain.


 # Infrastructure
 The Infrastructure section is dedicated to providing the technical underpinnings necessary for our application to function seamlessly. It encompasses all data persistence and data access implementations, following best practices such as the Repository pattern and fluent mapping
## Data Persistence: 
We've adopted the Repository pattern to abstract away the complexities of data access, providing a consistent interface for interacting with our data storage layer. Fluent mapping ensures that our domain entities are efficiently mapped to the underlying database schema, maintaining consistency and reliability.
## Unit of Work: 
To promote transactional integrity and ensure a cohesive approach to data manipulation, we've implemented the Unit of Work pattern. This pattern consolidates multiple operations into a single atomic transaction, guaranteeing that either all operations succeed or none at all.
## External Services Integration: 
Additionally, the Infrastructure section houses services responsible for integrating with external systems. By centralizing these integration points, we establish a unified approach to handling external data sources, enhancing maintainability and scalability.


# Presentation: 
The Presentation layer serves as the interface through which users interact with our application. It encompasses the actual APIs exposed to external consumers, facilitating seamless communication with our system.
## API Services: 
Within the Presentation layer, we host the APIs that expose the functionality of our application to external consumers. These services act as the primary entry point for clients, providing a standardized interface for accessing our system.
